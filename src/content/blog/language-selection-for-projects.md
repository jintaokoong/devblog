I recently found myself in a predicament when starting a greenfield project: choosing the right programming language. With various factors like my future plans, project timeline, team composition, and constraints in mind, I had to make a decision that would best suit our needs.

On one hand, there was Golangâ€”an efficient language with easy deployable binaries, flexibility, and extraordinary developer experience (DX). On the other hand, there was C# paired with .NET. While it boasted a wider talent pool and was more comfortable for my team, it came with drawbacks like a cumbersome deployment process, less enjoyable DX, and slower runtime.

In the end, considering all the constraints, I opted for C# and .NET. Personally, it might not have been my top choice, but it was the most practical given the circumstances.

Throughout the decision-making process, discussions with peers made me realize my strong aversion to .NET. While C# itself isn't the issue, it's the .NET framework that poses challenges. Its constraints often force developers into the object-oriented (OO) programming paradigm, which can lead to unnecessary abstraction patterns.

We're here to solve problems, not just write code. Code is merely a means to an end, not the end itself. Developers shouldn't be constrained to fit solutions into a particular paradigm when it's not the best fit. Object-oriented programming was a solution to past complexities, but now it sometimes feels like we're trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.

In contrast, Golang offers unparalleled freedom. It empowers developers with choices, whether to utilize design patterns or higher-level abstractions. Developers can start with simple solutions and refactor as needed, reducing cognitive load and enabling a focus on problem-solving rather than framework constraints.

I wanted to embrace .NET, but its inherent constraints on developers made it difficult to fully appreciate. Given the choice, I wouldn't consider it again.
